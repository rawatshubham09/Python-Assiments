1. What exactly is []?
Ans : [] it is Square Bracket but in Python it is known as "list"

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value &#39;hello&#39; as the
third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Let&#39;s pretend the spam includes the list [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;] for the next three queries.
Ans : spam.insert("&#39;hello&#39;",2)

3. What is the value of spam[int(int(&#39;3&#39; * 2) / 11)]?
Ans: Show an error

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans : It will print Last value in spam - "&#39;d&#39;"

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Ans : It will print First Two value of spam - "&#39;d&#39;", "&#39;d&#39;"


Let&#39;s pretend bacon has the list [3.14, &#39;cat,&#39; 11, &#39;cat,&#39; True] for the next three questions.

6. What is the value of bacon.index(&#39;cat&#39;)?
Ans index = 1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans : [3.14, &#39;cat,&#39; 11, &#39;cat,&#39; True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove(&#39;cat&#39;) change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans : [3.14, &#39;cat,&#39; 11, True, 99]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Ans : The meaning of the word concatenation tells everything about the functionality. ... In other words,
	  the concatenation operator connects one string at the end of the other. Replication Operator. 
	  The multiplication operator acts as a replication operator when we have one string and one integer as operands

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Ans : append() - this will add new values in the end of the list but insert() will take position and place
	  at that positon.
	  
11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Ans : pop() and remove()

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans :The similarity between Lists and Strings in Python is that both are sequences, hence both can iterate.

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Ans : The key difference between the tuples and lists is that while the tuples are immutable objects 
	  the lists are mutable. This means that tuples cannot be changed while the lists can be modified.
	  Tuples are more memory efficient than the lists
	  
14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Ans : (42)

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Ans : use list(tuple) for converting into List and tuple(list) for visa versa

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they
contain?
Ans : ex: name = ["Ravi","Vivek","kuldeep"]
		so name is a object of list and that list contain name of my friends.

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans : copy.copy() create a shallow copy of list (if we cange in copied list it give same change into orignal list).
	  copy.deepcop() creat a different address so that both list work saperately.
