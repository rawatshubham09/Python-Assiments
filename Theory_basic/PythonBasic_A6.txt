1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?
Ans : import re
	  r"Regex Exp" #Regex expression
	  
2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?
Ans : because they can be search using regexp expression.

3. What is the return value of the search() method?
Ans : "It will return every value of search expression. in list.(Complete word)"

4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?
Ans : pattern = r'expression'
	  re.find(pattern,string)
	  
5. In the regex which created from the r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)', what does group zero cover?
Group 2? Group 1?
Ans : Group0 : (\d\d\d) -> find ecery 3 digit no. before -
	  Group1 : (\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d) - > after - it will find every no. which is in pattern of 888-8888.

6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell
a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?
Ans : by using backslash '\' before parentheses. This is a escape character.

7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of
the two options?
Ans : This will return every possible pattern possible in string in a list.

8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?
Ans : this mean "or" -> |

9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?
Ans : character are use to tell what is a role in regular expression.
	  Ex : {2,4} - Match atleast 2 time but not more then 4.
	  
10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?
Ans : + mens search ans many possible
	  * means zero or as much as possible of previous character.
	  ex: ca*t -> cat, ct, caaaaaaaaaaat

11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?
Ans : {4} - atleast 4.
	  {4,5} - atleast 4 but not more than 5
	  
12. What do you mean by the \d, \w, and \s shorthand character classes signify in regular
expressions?
Ans : \d -> Digit
	  \w -> any character
	  \s -> white space

13. What do means by \D, \W, and \S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?
Ans : \D -> Except Digit
	  \W -> Except Character(Alphabet + symbols)
	  \S -> Expept White Space
	  
14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?
Ans : Both are same so no difference.

15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?
Ans : [\d\w] -> Match both digit and character.

16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?
Ans : So that they only select those character which are required with out noise data.

17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd
argument in re.compile()?
Ans : re.compile() -> help to form a regexp expression for further use in searching required patterns.
	  re.DOTALL -> re1DOTALL, re$DOTALL, re DOTALL.
	  

18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4
hen') return?
Ans : pass


19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?
Ans : re.VERBOSE : This flag allows you to write regular expressions that look nicer and 
	  are more readable by allowing you to visually separate logical sections of the pattern and add comments.
	  
20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must
match the given following:
'42'
'1,234'
'6,368,745'
Ans : r'\d{1,3}|[\d\d\d,]+'
